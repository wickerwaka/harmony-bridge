# Harmony Bridge

The Harmony series of universal remotes from Logitech are great remotes with support for a lot of devices. I have been using them for ten years and currently own three of them.
The hub-based remotes are able to talk to IP/Wifi devices such as Rokus, Phillips Hue bulbs or Nest thermostats, however they lack support custom network devices.

This project uses the Harmony's Bluetooth keyboard support and a Raspberry Pi 3 to route commands from the remote control to anything that is accessible from a python script, including local and remote HTTP endpoints.
